## üìù Analytical Insights  

- **Median vs. Mean**:  
  - For salary analysis, we used the **median value**, as salaries within the same job title (e.g., Data Scientist, ML Engineer) can vary significantly‚Äîfrom very low to extremely high.  
  - The **mean salary** is sensitive to outliers. For example, a few employees earning exceptionally high salaries (e.g., $1M) skew the average upward, distorting the overall picture.  
  - On the other hand, the **median salary** provides a more accurate representation of actual salary levels, as it is unaffected by abnormally high values. This makes it a better metric for comparing salaries across job titles.  
- **Geographic Insights**:  
  - The **United States** is the most popular country for job vacancies, with 1929 listings.  
  - **Israel** boasts the highest recorded median salary, while **North Macedonia** has the lowest.  
- **Company Size**: Medium-sized companies offer the **highest average salaries** compared to smaller or larger companies.  
- **Remote Work**:  
  - **No correlation** was found between salary levels and remote work.  
  - A majority (96.3%) of employees work in their country of residence.  
  - Among remote employees working for companies in other countries, **Russia** has the highest rate (50%), followed by **Argentina** and **Italy**.  
- **Profile of the Most Successful Professionals**:  
  - Holds a leadership role (e.g., Data Science Tech Lead, Cloud Data Architect, Data Lead).  
  - Based in **Israel**, **Puerto Rico**, or the **US**.  
  - Works for a **medium-sized company**.  
  - Operates either **fully remotely** or **on-site full-time**.
